Meditation is a practice where an individual focuses one's attention on a thought, object, or activity
to train attention and achieve an emotionally calm state. In recent times, where social media has the norm among the young population,
the increase in levels of anxiety, stress, and depression. In addition, the average attention span of a normal individual has decreased
to only two seconds per person which has lead to a decrease in productivity. By improving our emotional state and attention,we can conquer
anxiety, depression, and attention disorders. Meditation is one of the only natural ways to attack the mental illness and productivity
issue facing the western world today.</p></div>



Meditation was first developed in India, a very long time ago. The oldest documented evidence of the practice of meditation are wall arts in the Indian subcontinent
from approximately 5,000 to 3,500 BCE, showing people seated in meditative postures with half-closed eyes. Written evidence of any form of meditation was first seen
in the Vedas around 1500 BCE. In India, the tradition of Guru and Shishya (teacher and disciple) has been around for ages, where students were sent to Gurukuls
(schools) mostly in the forests to live and learn under a learned teacher. During this time and for centuries before, all learning and knowledge was passed on by
word of mouth. Almost all the Hindu religious books talk of meditation in some form or the other. So we can safely assume that meditation was also an integral
part of the knowledge that the Gurus were teaching their students, and all this was done via the oral tradition. And because it was oral, it is not documented
and hence gets very difficult to tell how old meditation really is.

Around the 6th to 5th centuries BCE, other forms of meditation developed in Taoist China and Buddhist India. Dhyana in early Buddhism also takes influence on Vedanta
by ca. the 4th century BCE.

The exact origins of Buddhist meditation are subject to debate among scholars. Early written records of the multiple levels and states of meditation in Buddhism in
India are found in the sutras of the Pāli Canon, which dates to 1st century BCE. The Pali Canon records the basic fourfold formula of salvation via the observance
of the rules of morality, contemplative concentration, knowledge and liberation, thus placing meditation as a step along the path of salvation. By the time Buddhism
was spreading in China, the Vimalakirti Sutra which dates to 100CE included a number of passages on meditation and enlightened wisdom, clearly pointing to Zen.

In the west, by 20 BCE Philo of Alexandria had written on some form of "spiritual exercises" involving attention (prosoche) and concentration and by the 3rd century
Plotinus had developed meditative techniques, which however did not attract a following among Christian meditators. Saint Augustine experimented with the methods
of Plotinus and failed to achieve ecstasy.

The Silk Road transmission of Buddhism introduced meditation to other oriental countries. Bodhidharma is traditionally considered the transmitter of the concept
of Zen to China. However, the first "original school" in East Asia was founded by his contemporary Zhiyi in the 6th century in central China. Zhiyi managed to
systematically organize the various teachings that had been imported from India in a way that their relationship with each other made sense. Wonhyo and Uisang
promoted Korean Buddhism in the 7th century.

There is evidence that Judaism has inherited meditative practices from its predecessor traditions[citation needed] in Israelite antiquity. For instance, in the
Torah, the patriarch Isaac is described as going "lasuach" in the field - a term understood by most commentators as some type of meditative practice (Genesis 24:63). There are indications throughout the Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible) that Judaism always contained a central meditative tradition.</p>

The first type of meditation is mindfulness of breath. The most basic way to do mindful breathing is simply to focus your attention on your breath, the inhale and exhale.
You can do this while standing, but ideally you’ll be sitting or even lying in a comfortable position. Your eyes may be open or closed, but you may find it easier to
maintain your focus if you close your eyes. It can help to set aside a designated time for this exercise, but it can also help to practice it when you’re feeling
particularly stressed or anxious. Experts believe a regular practice of mindful breathing can make it easier to do it in difficult situations.

Sometimes, especially when trying to calm yourself in a stressful moment, it might help to start by taking an exaggerated breath: a deep inhale through your nostrils
(3 seconds), hold your breath (2 seconds), and a long exhale through your mouth (4 seconds). Otherwise, simply observe each breath without trying to adjust it; it may
help to focus on the rise and fall of your chest or the sensation through your nostrils. As you do so, you may find that your mind wanders, distracted by thoughts or
bodily sensations. That’s OK. Just notice that this is happening and gently bring your attention back to your breath. Continue doing this for 15 to 30 minutes twice
a day to feel the full effects of this meditation.</p></div>


The second type of meditation is Loving Kindness Meditation. To do loving kindness meditation, you first have to calm your mind and anchor it to your breath. Once your
mind is settled and you can focus, begin by imagining a baby. Keep picturing the baby until you have a feeling of love in your heart. Afterwards, move on to picturing
your friends and family. They are all laughing and joyful, free from suffering. Keep picturing this as your feeling of love gets stronger. Next picture what you fear.
It does not need to be humans. Once you have generated love for what you fear, you are ready to generate love for who you hate. Imagine the person you hate being mean
to you. Use all the love that you have generated within you, and learn to accept them for who they are. Finally, you are ready for the final step. You now have enough
love to accept yourself. Imagine yourself as you are right now. Feel the love inside of you go through your body all over like a positive luminous force that is soothing
every cell in your body. Try to do this powerful meditation twice a day for 30 minutes to receive the full benefits. </p></div>
